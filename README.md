**Why did you build this**

Because for some reason, Vietnam Ministry of Health reckons the best way to provide statistical data in a list (neither a regular medium PDF or WORD file). 
This data should be available in machine-readble formats for transparency and to enable ease of access.
Date Time Type: DD/MM/YYYY Please make me a favor to converse in YYYY/MM/DD when importing into DB

**Want to use this in Google Sheets**
